## About The Project
This is a project our team is working on to help solve the issue of cluttered blogging sites. After signing up, users can login, write posts, view/comment other user posts and see time stamps for activities.
The front end is a single page application comprised of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The backend consists of API endpoints that handle user requests using Java, Javalin and JDBC. The database uses PostGres as a vendor and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
User First Name, Last Name, ID and Comments are stored on a persistent database. The database is constantly updated by user input. A feed displays on the webpage with data pulled from the database.

## Testing
Our team implemented TDD. The RTM, Test Plan Document, Test Case Design Report and Defect Report are attached in this repository. We used Cucumber and Gherkin to write 5 feature files then implemented the steps via testNG. Our team used Selenium to automate the webrowser and perfrom e2e testing. API endpoint testing was done using Postman. Database testing was done using Mockito.
